			<h1 style="padding-top: 50px;"> Paris in a Weekend </h1> <i>by Chloé Dorgan</i> 
			<p>
                Last summer, I was finally able to introduce my husband to the country where I was raised. We had a trip to France planned in June 2020 but it had to be canceled, like most people’s travel plans during the pandemic. This trip has been in the works for 9 years, ever since we started dating and I would wistfully talk about fresh bread and cheese from home
			</p>
            <p>
                I wanted to make sure that my husband got to see a good chunk of the Paris region where I grew up, but also the countryside and the mountains. A missed connection in Dallas meant that we lost a day so we were on an even tighter schedule than before. With this in mind, I present to you the speediest Paris tour that will still give you a good taste of our capital.				
            </p>
			<h3>Day 1: Classic Vistas & Avenues</h3>

                <li>The Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysées: 
                    Walk down to George V and hop back on Métro Line 1 to Place Concorde.

                <li>The Tuileries Gardens:
                    Exit at Place Concorde and walk through the Tuileries Gardens until the Louvre.

                </li>
                <li> Les Halles:
                A great option for lunch is the legendary Au Pied de Cochon, but there are many other restaurant options in this neighborhood.

                <li>Dinner on the Quais:
                Find a local grocery store and buy picnic dinner materials and bottles of wine. Find a spot further down East on the river and enjoy the sunset on the banks of the Seine

            </ul>
            <h3>Day 2: Winding Streets and Back-Alleys</h3>

                <li>Notre-Dame de Paris:

                <li>Île saint-Louis: 
                    Meander through the narrow streets of this small island in the Seine. If visiting in summertime, enjoy the péniches (restaurants on barges) along Voie Georges Pompidou.

                <li> Le Marais:

			<h3 style="padding-top: 50px;">Château de Versailles" </h3>
            <p>The Château de Versailles, also known as the Palace of Versailles, is an opulent royal residence located in Versailles, France. It was originally a hunting lodge built by King Louis XIII in the 17th century but was transformed into a magnificent palace by his son, King Louis XIV. 
                The palace is renowned for its lavish architecture, exquisite gardens, and its role as the center of political power in France during the reign of the Sun King. It played a pivotal role in French history, hosting the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, which formally ended World War I. Today, it stands as a symbol of absolute monarchy and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors annually.

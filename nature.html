			<h1 style="padding-top: 50px;"> Hiking the Alps </h1>
			<p>
				Hit the trails this summer and enjoy the majestic beauty of the mountains. We have gathered two fantastic hikes for you to choose from to discover the Alps.

			<h3>The Pas du Boret & Bout du Monde</h3>
			<p>
		  <img style="float: left; max-width: 400px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 10px;"

				The Cirque du Fer-à-Cheval is a magnificent glacial valley, with vertical rock faces that soar above the valley floor. Mountain peaks that reach nearly 9850 ft loom over the Cirque. The best way to appreciate it is to hike up the Pas du Boret and then continue to the Bout du Monde (“End of the World”) at the head of the valley. The views over the valley are unforgettable. 
				The trail departs from a parking area and restaurant (about 3 miles up the Giffre River valley from Sixt-Fer-à-Cheval); it’s a broad, level path through a forest. Upon reaching a small café, the Buvette du Prazon, the main trail continues straight up the valley beside the river. The trail for the Pas du Boret branches off to the left here – and it’s no longer a level path! 
			</p>
			<p> 
				The route first crosses a flat, rocky surface sloping upward. Small triangles painted on rocks point the way to a narrow trail that climbs in switchbacks up the steep slope. The trail is exposed, with a vertical drop on the valley side. Cables attached to the rock on the opposite side of the trail offer security. This climb concludes with an easy trail through a forest, leading to the Buvette du Boret.
				This charming restaurant is a good place to pause. Sitting at a table here, you have the impression of being upon a balcony overlooking the valley and facing the cliffs on the opposite side. A trail leads from the restaurant, through a forest, down to the Bout du Monde. The view down the valley from this point is truly breathtaking. Impossible to walk past it without taking a photo! The trail then continues down the valley. Where it levels off, there is a suspended footbridge, giving the hiker the choice of walking along either side of the Giffre River back to the parking area. Numerous waterfalls offer a dazzling display along the way.

			<h3> Col des Montets to the Brévent, via Lac Blanc </h3>
			<p>
		  <img style="float: right; max-width: 400px; padding-left: 15px;

			<p>
				A two-day hike from Col des Montets to the Brévent, with a night at the Lac Blanc refuge (hut), this hike follows the “Grand Balcon Sud” (the Great Southern Balcony) on the north side of the Chamonix Valley. The hike presents iconic views of the Mont Blanc massif across the valley, and indeed the entire region from the summit 
				of the Brévent. The trail begins beside a chalet that serves as the information center for a nature reserve, the Réserve Naturelle des Aiguilles Rouges. 
			</p>
			<p> 
				Starting with a climb, the trail then levels off to pass several picturesque lakes, the Lacs des Chésreys. Along the way, you are likely to see bouquetins (ibex) close to the trail. They are accustomed to encountering hikers, so they are not shy or fearful. After the lakes, there are several ladders bolted to rock faces to be climbed. Then you reach Lac Blanc and its refuge (7,715 ft), a comfortable place that offers meals and accommodation. There will likely be ice on the lake and snow fields around it well into the summer.
				Many of the people whom you meet in the refuge will have hiked up from the Flégère cable car, and they will return to Chamonix on that lift the next day. 
			</p>
		<p>
			A much more interesting and challenging itinerary traverses from Lac Blanc to the Col de l’Index. From the Index, the trail descends into the Combe de la Glière and then climbs to the Col de la Glière (8,074 ft). The route from here to the Col du Lac Cornu is level but requires some scrambling over boulders. Below the trail on the right (west), the Lacs Noirs invite the hiker to make a detour. A long descent from the Col du Lac Cornu leads to Planpraz. If you wish to end the hike here, there is a télécabine (cable car) down to Chamonix. Otherwise, climb the trail from Planpraz to the Col du Brévent and on to the summit of the Brévent. In addition to bouquetins, watch for chamois on this trail! The Brévent offers a spectacular view of Mont Blanc (15,780 ft). A téléphérique (cable car) links the summit to Planpraz and the télécabine for Chamonix.
